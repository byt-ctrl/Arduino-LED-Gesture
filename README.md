# Arduino-LED-Gesture
The project uses a webcam to identify hand gestures for controlling an Arduino using the number of fingers raised. The communication between Python and Arduino in controlling LEDs is due to the 'pyFirmata' library. There is real-time feedback, and it can be easily extended to include more sensors or devices.
